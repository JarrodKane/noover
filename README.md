# React + TypeScript + Vite


Used the React + TypeScript + Vite template to create a new project.
I wanted to get something up and going quickly.
1. Create a project with a template
2. Add in DB that is needed with bad data we want to test against
3. Display the data in a table
4. Testing bad data


## Assumptions
1. The order of the rows I did by the order of the data in the array. I did not sort the data by the id.
2. I did not collect any of the bad data, I just removed it from the table.
3. There always has to be at least 1 ceo in the table, otherwise everyone will have a bad manager link and never be displayed

## Things to improve
The looping through the tree in order to make the table, could get the table off the columns, and rows, then just populate the fileds needed

## Project setup
Clone the project, cd into the project and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
